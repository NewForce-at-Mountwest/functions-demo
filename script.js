// Any time we find ourselves writing the same piece of code more than once, we should probably put it in a function

// Simple function that console.logs something


// Function that takes a name as a parameter and console.logs a greeting





// Function that takes an HTML string and an id and prints something to the DOM



// Call the function with a random html string



// Return statements

// Write a function that accepts an array of taco toppings and builds an html string about the finished taco
// Try to log the finishedTaco variable to the console outside the function! It won't work
// Return the taco
// Store it in a variable
// Log the variable
